Through theoretical developments and experimental validations, we investigate how cycle navigation can be leveraged to enhance the efficiency and reliability of robotic systems. The work combines control theory, set methods, and practical engineering to develop novel approaches for achieving stable, repeatable motions in challenging underwater environments.</p> <p>Key contributions include new methods for cycle stabilization, energy-efficient locomotion patterns, and robust control strategies that can be applied to various robotic platforms. The research addresses both fundamental theoretical aspects and practical implementation challenges, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and utilizing cyclic behaviors in robotic applications.</p> <p><a href="../../assets/pdf/thesis.pdf" class="btn btn-primary mb-3" target="_blank"> <i class="fa-solid fa-file-pdf"></i> Download thesis PDF </a></p> <h2 id="organization">Organization</h2> <p>The thesis defence will take place on Wednesday, 15 October 2025 at 9:30 a.m. at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZE44hDHSAHqKqASJ7" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ENSTA Bretagne</a>.</p> <h2 id="jury">Jury</h2> <h3 id="reviewers">Reviewers</h3> <ul> <li>Professor Sylvain Durand, University of Strasbourg, France</li> <li>Professor Andreas Rauh, University of Oldenburg, Germany</li> </ul> <h3 id="examinators">Examinators</h3> <ul> <li>Professor Frédéric Boyer, LS2N, Centrale Nantes, France</li> <li>Professor Lionel Lapierre, LIRMM, University of Montpellier, France</li> <li>Professor Philippe Xu, ENSTA, France</li> <li>Associate Professor, LIRMM, University of Montpellier, France</li> </ul> <h3 id="supervisors">Supervisors</h3> <ul> <li>Professor Luc Jaulin, Lab-STICC, ENSTA, France,</li> <li>Associate Professor Fabrice Le Bars, Lab-STICC, ENSTA, France</li> </ul> </body></html>
