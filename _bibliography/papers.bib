    abstract={The study of underwater acoustic wave propagation provides solutions to localization and underwater navigation problems. In these cases, simulation can be a powerful tool for a better understanding of acoustic propagation. These simulations are based on models that rely on simplifying assumptions allowing the numerical resolution. Simulation is also used to solve more specific problems in underwater environments. For instance, acoustic source localization using receivers in an underwater scene is still a challenging problem and has both civil and military applications. Classical methods are based on the use of acoustic receiver arrays placed in the environment. Assuming a normal modes model for the propagation, collected data are then processed, for example, by singular value decomposition or matched field processing based approach, which provides probabilistic results. The proposed approach to solve this problem is to use set methods. This method allows enclosing all source positions compatible with the recorded hydrophone signal. In addition, possible sets for source position compatible with each receiver can be intersected to increase the certainty of the source location. Besides requiring a good knowledge of the scene, this method requires simulating the acoustic propagation as well as possible to correctly solve this localization problem.}
