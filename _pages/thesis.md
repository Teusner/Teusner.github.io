# Event-driven Cycle Navigation for Mobile Robots 

This thesis explores the fascinating world of stable cycles in robotics, with a particular focus on marine vehicles. Through theoretical developments and experimental validations, we investigate how cycle navigation can be leveraged to enhance the efficiency and reliability of robotic systems. The work combines control theory, set methods, and practical engineering to develop novel approaches for achieving stable, repeatable motions in challenging underwater environments.

Key contributions include new methods for cycle stabilization, energy-efficient locomotion patterns, and robust control strategies that can be applied to various robotic platforms. The research addresses both fundamental theoretical aspects and practical implementation challenges, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and utilizing cyclic behaviors in robotic applications.
