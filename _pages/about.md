French robotics engineer graduated from [ENSTA Bretagne](https://ensta-bretagne.fr) and from the master of science of the [University of Angers](https://www.univ-angers.fr) in 2021.

Passionate about diving, my work is oriented towards marine and underwater robotics. I had the opportunity to gain experience in this field during my studies in Brest, but also with companies like [Forssea Robotics](https://forssea-robotics.fr/).

I am currently pursuing my studies as PhD candidate in underwater robotics under the supervision of [Luc Jaulin](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/) and [Fabrice Lebars](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/lebars/) at [ENSTA Bretagne](https://ensta-bretagne.fr).
